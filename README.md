# EMOTION-CLASSIFIER-FOR-NEPALI-TEXT-USING-SVM
This repo contains the code for employing svm model on nepali dataset for emotion analysis.
Different emotion labels represent following emotions:
#0-happy
#1-sad
#2-angry
#3-surprise
#4-fear, 
I have used pretrained bert-based-multilingual-cased tokenizer and embedding. 
Dataset used for training the model is also uloaded.
